      essayText :"A deserted island, left alone with only yourself, other children, and no parental authority. At first you would think it is the best place in the world, but after a while you will wish you be in your bed back at home with your parents at your side. A plane crashes on a unknown island, which only the children survive. No one knows they are their, so they they live on the island. The Bible setting is in the Garden of Eden, which is recreacted in LOTF. Golding novel is very popular in which took place during a World War.Golding choose to allegorize the Bible by showing the connection between how characters act towards temptations and the boys actions on the island. Golding is able to show that humans are unable to act violent towards another, but can only change his or her nature as a result of the environment. Golding uses the actions of Jack when becoming a hunter during, and after hunting for pigs to show Golding commentary of  humans are unable to act violent towards another, but can only change their nature as a result of the environment. When Jack first went hunting, he found a pig which he “hurled the spear” at only to have “The patterning of pig trotters died away in the distance.” Jack missed the kill on the pig, which shows Golding commentary. If Jack didn't go alone and worked harder for a stronger spear, he could have killed the pig, but didn’t because he doesn’t want to think about how he took a living creature life himself. However, by letting the fire go out when a ship came by, the twins were carrying “The gutted carcass of a pig.” Jack and the hunters finally killed a pig, which shows Golding commentary. In a environment were the only protean you get is from living animals, the environment forces the children to kill, who shouldn’t be experienced or doing these types of things in the first place at such a young age.In addition to Jack actions when hunting, Golding also uses the dialogue between in  Piggy and Ralph’s argument to show Golding commentary of  humans are unable to act violent towards another, but can only change their nature as a result of the environment. Even though Piggy has the conch, people still talk and don’t respect him which made “Piggy lost his temper. I got the couch!  Just you listen!” Piggy is extremely anger and has started screaming and yelling at everyone just to get his point across, which shows Golding commentary. Because of the tension of the environment, and since everyone wants to go home and be safe, it causes Piggy not to be physically violent but to get verbal violent so he can help everyone think properly so they can go home as quick as possible. When Piggy states that he could never get a count on how many people there were, Jack just told him to “shut up.” Jack is getting more violent towards Piggy, which shows Golding commentary. Jack says this phrase more to anyone on this island meaning that he is tired of listening to one of the oldest complain a lot, meaning he isn’t thinking straight since Piggy is only trying to help regain stability until help comes.Golding uses the actions and dialogue of the characters to create her commentary of humans are unable to act violent towards another, but can only change his or her nature as a result of the environment. Golding allegorizes the Bible in LOTF to create a commentary on human nature without government.  Golding novel inspires its readers to not being affected by what is going on around them even if the distraction is at them, but to always act natural."
